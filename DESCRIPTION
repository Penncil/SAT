Description: Electronic health records (EHR) enable investigation of the association between 
    phenotypes and risk factors. However, studies solely relying on potentially error-prone 
    EHR-derived phenotypes (i.e., surrogates) are subject to bias. Analyses of low prevalence 
    phenotypes may also suffer from poor efficiency. For analyzing rare diseases, we develop a 
    Surrogate Assisted Two-wave (SAT) sampling method to select a subsample for outcome 
    validation through manual chart review subject to budget constraints. 
    A model is then fitted based on the subsample. The subsample selected with the proposed 
    method contains informative observations that effectively reduce the mean squared error (MSE) 
    of the resultant estimator of the association.
